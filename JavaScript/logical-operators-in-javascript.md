# Logical Operators in JavaScript

## Logical AND

The Logical AND uses the `&&` operator. If all operands are `true` it returns `true`, otherwise `false` is returned.

```javascript
const a = 3;
const b = -2;

console.log(a > 0 && b > 0);
// expected output: false
```

## Logical OR

The Logical OR uses the `||` operator. Returns `true` if one or more of the operands is true.

```javascript
const a = 3;
const b = -2;

console.log(a > 0 || b > 0);
// expected output: true
```

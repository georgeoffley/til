# Union Type

[Source](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types)

A type which is formed by two or more types.

### Example

```javascript
type jim: string | number;
```

So the above will allow us to make a variable with the type `jim` which is either a number or a number.

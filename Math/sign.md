# Sign

Sign refers to the property of being either positive or negative. You can also thing of sign as the direction on a number line. It is either `1` or `-1`

Every real number that is non-zero is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless.

`sign(x) = direction/either positive or negative`

## Example

Below we can see numbers on the number line as signed.

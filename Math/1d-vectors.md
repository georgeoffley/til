# 1D Vectors

Vectors have a size or a magnitude and a direction.

The length of the line shows its magnitude and the arrowhead points in the direction.

Something like `[1]` is a One Dimensional vector as we are going from one point on the horizontal number line to another. We are going either left or right.

## Subtraction

Something like `(3 - 1)` can be a vector as we're looking for the distance. So assuming the order is correct we would get `2` as the line goes to three and we go back one.

## Addition

Same thing for addition. If we're at position `3` and then we add `1` we take our vector at space `3` and add one more space. Getting `4`.

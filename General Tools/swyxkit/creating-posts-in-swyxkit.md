# Setting Up Swyxkit For A New Blog

[Source](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit)

When you want to create a post you need to do the following:

1. Go to the `Issues` section of the GitHub repo you have your blog on.
2. Create a new issue.
3. The issue is your blog post. It's all markdown so it should be set already to just enter in your post.
4. Apply the `Published` tag to the issue so that it will be published on the site.

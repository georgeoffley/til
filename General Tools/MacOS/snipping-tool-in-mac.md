# Snipping Tool In MacOS

[Awesome Source](https://www.ias.edu/itg/content/keyboard-shortcuts-capture-screen-shot-mac-os-x#:~:text=To%20copy%20a%20portion%20of,screen%20shot%20to%20another%20application.)

The Mac snipping tool shortcut is:

`Command + Shift + 4`

This will give the grey overlay and allow you to choose what to snip. Gives you a menu and everything.

Now the really useful one is 

`Command + Ctrl + Shift + 4`

This will change your cursor to a crosshairs and you can snip the area of the screen you want, but this will copy it to your clipboard once you release the mouse button. 

Becuase I use a four quadrant screen workflow, I could also take advantage of using

`Command + Ctrl + Shift + 4 + Spacebar`

This brings up a prompt to take a picture of any of the application windows that are up.

# Setting Text Attributes

[Source](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/)

Material UI also gives you the ability to put text in between `<Typeography>` tags to set text in the right font and other attributes.

## Example

```jsx
<Typography className=''>
    Some Text
    <Link href="https://mui.com/material-ui/react-link/">
        Test Link
    </Link>
</Typography>

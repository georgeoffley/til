# Using Arbitrary Value For Colors

[Source](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#arbitrary-values)

In Tailwind if you have a color which is only used once you can actually use arbitrary values for the one tag rather than adding it to your theme. 

### Example

You can use this for color based tags like font or background color. 

`bg-[#21222A]`

The above is the class. You add in the prefix for whatever it is, background or text, a dash, and square brackets with the Hex value.

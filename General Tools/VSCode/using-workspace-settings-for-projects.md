# Using Workspace Settings For Projects

In VSCode you can configure settings that are specific to a project. For example in using the Fable Engine project there are settings needed to resolve many of the errors that standard settings flag in VSCode, like where packages are and imports. 

If you clone a project that has some of these settings saved in a `.vscode` directory these are saved workspace settings. You can use these settings by opening a new empty window, and then opening the project directly. VScode should use the settings stored in the `.vscode` directory and will prompt you to install any suggested extensions.

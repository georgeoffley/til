## Explanation and Notes

**[Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html)**

The resources section is where you outline and define all the AWS resources that you want for the stack.

One example was defining an IAM role for use in authenticating a request to admin API endpoints. Properties and policies are defined there. However, it can be used to define any AWS service that you might need.

## Explanation and Notes

**[Outputs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html)**

`Outputs` sections in CloudFormation files are output values that can be imported into other stacks. They can also be used to describe stack calls by returning a response and make it easier to view stuff on the CloudFormation console.

You would use the `Export` block to create cross-stack exports you can use.
